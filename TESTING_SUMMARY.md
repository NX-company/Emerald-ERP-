# Sales Module - Testing Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed DealDetailSheet.tsx
**Problem:** Form didn't update when switching between different deals.

**Solution:** Added `useEffect` hook that calls `form.reset()` when the `deal` prop changes:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (deal) {
    form.reset({
      client_name: deal.client_name || "",
      company: deal.company || "",
      amount: deal.amount || "",
      stage: deal.stage || "new",
      deadline: deal.deadline ? new Date(deal.deadline).toISOString().slice(0, 16) : "",
      manager_id: deal.manager_id || "",
      tags: deal.tags || [],
    });
  }
}, [deal, form]);
```

### 2. Verified DealCreateDialog.tsx
**Status:** ✅ Already working correctly

The form reset was already implemented in the `onSuccess` handler (line 79):
```typescript
onSuccess: () => {
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/deals"] });
  toast({ title: "Успешно", description: "Сделка создана" });
  form.reset();  // ✅ Already here
  onOpenChange(false);
}
```

### 3. Installed nanoid Package
